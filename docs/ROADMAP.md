## Principles (Never Change)

1. **Math is truth, curricula are overlays**
   - Keep knowledge graph separate from teaching systems
   
2. **Zero stress, zero pressure**
   - No scores, no streaks, no social competition
   
3. **Open and accessible**
   - MIT licensed, community-driven, free forever
   
4. **Data-driven, not algorithm-driven**
   - Explicit relationships, no black boxes
   
5. **Quality over quantity**
   - Accuracy is non-negotiable
   
6. **Respect learners**
   - No dark patterns, no manipulation, no ads
