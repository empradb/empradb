# 🖤 EmpraDB

The World's Largest Math Database & Study Hub

EmpraDB is an open-source, world-scale mathematical knowledge database and study hub.

## What It Is

- A complete graph of mathematical knowledge
- Curriculum and exam-aware
- Search-first, distraction-free
- Zero-stress study planning

## What It Is Not

- Not a calculator
- Not a gamified app
- Not a course platform

## Architecture

EmpraDB separates truth from teaching:

- **Math Knowledge Graph**: Immutable mathematical relationships
- **Curriculum Layer**: Year-level and system-aware overlays
- **Exam Intelligence**: Concept mapping for standardized tests
- **Study Hub**: Generated learning paths, no pressure mechanics

## Supported Systems

- VCE (Australia)
- GCSE / A-Level (UK)
- IB (International)
- AP (US)
- SAT / ACT
- University introductory mathematics
- Olympiad tracks

## Mission

Make mathematics structured, accessible, and stress-free for everyone.

## Philosophy

Math is universal. Curricula are overlays. Tests are filters. Study paths are generated, not hardcoded.

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
